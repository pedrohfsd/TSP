The goal here is to talk about and share common solutions to this problem, as well as implementing and executing them on random instances. Yes, that's right, nothing is better than plotting the graph and see the magic taking place live ;).

Never heard of the Traveling Salesman Problem? It's ok, just read the [Introduction](https://pedrohfsd.github.io/TSP/intro) page.

### What algorithms will we cover?
Three classes of algorithms will be covered:

**Meta-Heuristic**
- [Genetic Algorithm](https://pedrohfsd.github.io/TSP/genetic_algorithm.html)
- [Simulated Annealing](https://pedrohfsd.github.io/TSP/simulated_annealing.html)

**Heuristic**
- Nearest Neighbour Search
- Twice Around The Tree
- Matching Based
- Adjacent Pairwise
- General Pairwise
- 2-OPT
- 3-OPT

**Exact**
- Integer Programming
- Simple Branch and Bound
- Eastman Branch and Bound
- Branch and Bound over Hungarian Method
- Little et al Branch and Bound
